# School Projects
## Important Info
All projects included were made at different points of my college career. Various techniques have been taught to me at various times, so please take inefficiencies and mistakes with a grain of salt.

It is also important to note, that ***I do not take credit for every file that is included.*** Some files are required for my projects to compile and were supplied by the professor. I do my best to mark my name on files that I created and specify if I edited a file I did not create. If you are unsure if I made or edited a certain file, please feel free to ask!

### Mars MIPS Assembly Millipede
Using Mars MIPS, I created a Millipede game for my CS447. It uses a modified version of Mars to assemble and takes advantage of the RBG display module to display game graphics. The player uses arrow keys to move and 'B' to shoot. The player wins when the player completely destroys the millipede but loses if the player gets hit.
